    <h5 class="section__header"> What is the issue we are trying to solve?</h5>

    <p class="section__description">
      Our application is built to address the critical issue of climate change by encouraging induviduals to manage
      their carbon footprint by calculating the amount of CO2 emmissions they create in their everyday lives. Carbon
      dioxide is a primary greenhouse gas which is responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. Increase
      human activity haas been increasing the amount of CO2 emmissions, which significantly contributes to global
      warming. Global warming has many negative affects on our environment, including extreme weather events, melting
      ice caps, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, forest threats, etc. Just by making simple changes in our
      lifestyle, we can slow down the rate of global warming.
